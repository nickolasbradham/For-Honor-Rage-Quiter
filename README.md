# For Honor Rage Quiter
Puts whatever is in your clipboard in chat and disable-enables your ethernet adapter to disconnect you from the match and avoid the matchmaking timeout.

Only works on Windows due to using `ipconfig /release-renew` to interrupt your connection.

## Hotkeys
- `F1` to rage quit the match.
- `Back Quote` (the key to the left of `1`) to close the program.
